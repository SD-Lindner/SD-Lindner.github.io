My research focuses on complex systems and network science applied to health and language. I have established data-driven frameworks for epidemiology and healthcare analytics, ranging from wastewater-based forecasting to mapping gender-specific multimorbidity networks.

Currently, I am expanding these methods to natural language processing by analyzing the semantic topology of legal texts at the [SUSTech-ETH Risks-X Institute](https://risks-x.sustech.edu.cn/about.html?lang=en-us). This expertise underpins my proposed research in computational psychiatry, where I aim to track temporal network dynamics in psychotherapy to predict patient outcomes and visualize therapeutic change.

I completed my PhD in Complex Systems at the Medical University of Vienna, where I worked on data-driven approaches to healthcare analytics and wastewater-based epidemiology. As a member of Austria's COVID-19 Forecasting Committee, I developed forecasts that informed national public health decisions.
